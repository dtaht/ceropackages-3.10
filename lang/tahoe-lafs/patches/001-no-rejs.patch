-Below is a list of known issues in recent releases of Tahoe-LAFS, and how to
-manage them.  The current version of this file can be found at

-  *  `Command-line arguments are leaked to other local users`_
-  *  `Capabilities may be leaked to web browser phishing filter / "safe browsing" servers`_

-Unauthorized access by JavaScript in unrelated files
-----------------------------------------------------
-
-If you view a file stored in Tahoe-LAFS through a web user interface,
-JavaScript embedded in that file can, in some circumstances, access other
-files or directories stored in Tahoe-LAFS that you view through the same
-web user interface.  Such a script would be able to send the contents of
-those other files or directories to the author of the script, and if you
-have the ability to modify the contents of those files or directories,
-then that script could modify or delete those files or directories.
-
-This attack is known to be possible when an attacking tab or window could
-reach a tab or window containing a Tahoe URI by navigating back or forward
-in the history, either from itself or from any frame with a known name (as
-specified by the "target" attribute of an HTML link). It might be possible
-in other cases depending on the browser.
-
-*how to manage it*
-
-For future versions of Tahoe-LAFS, we are considering ways to close off
-this leakage of authority while preserving ease of use -- the discussion
-of this issue is ticket `#615`_.
-
-For the present, either do not view files stored in Tahoe-LAFS through a
-web user interface, or turn off JavaScript in your web browser before
-doing so, or limit your viewing to files which you know don't contain
-malicious JavaScript.
-
-.. _#615: https://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs/ticket/615
-
-
-----
-
-Disclosure of file through embedded hyperlinks or JavaScript in that file
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-
-If there is a file stored on a Tahoe-LAFS storage grid, and that file
-gets downloaded and displayed in a web browser, then JavaScript or
-hyperlinks within that file can leak the capability to that file to a
-third party, which means that third party gets access to the file.
-
-If there is JavaScript in the file, then it could deliberately leak
-the capability to the file out to some remote listener.
-
-If there are hyperlinks in the file, and they get followed, then
-whichever server they point to receives the capability to the
-file. Note that IMG tags are typically followed automatically by web
-browsers, so being careful which hyperlinks you click on is not
-sufficient to prevent this from happening.
-
-*how to manage it*
-
-For future versions of Tahoe-LAFS, we are considering ways to close off
-this leakage of authority while preserving ease of use -- the discussion
-of this issue is ticket `#127`_.
-
-For the present, a good work-around is that if you want to store and
-view a file on Tahoe-LAFS and you want that file to remain private, then
-remove from that file any hyperlinks pointing to other people's servers
-and remove any JavaScript unless you are sure that the JavaScript is not
-written to maliciously leak access.
-
-.. _#127: https://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs/ticket/127
-
-
-----
-
-Command-line arguments are leaked to other local users
-------------------------------------------------------
-
-Remember that command-line arguments are visible to other users (through
-the 'ps' command, or the windows Process Explorer tool), so if you are
-using a Tahoe-LAFS node on a shared host, other users on that host will
-be able to see (and copy) any caps that you pass as command-line
-arguments.  This includes directory caps that you set up with the "tahoe
-add-alias" command.
-
-*how to manage it*
-
-As of Tahoe-LAFS v1.3.0 there is a "tahoe create-alias" command that does
-the following technique for you.
-
-Bypass add-alias and edit the NODEDIR/private/aliases file directly, by
-adding a line like this:
-
-  fun: URI:DIR2:ovjy4yhylqlfoqg2vcze36dhde:4d4f47qko2xm5g7osgo2yyidi5m4muyo2vjjy53q4vjju2u55mfa
-
-By entering the dircap through the editor, the command-line arguments
-are bypassed, and other users will not be able to see them. Once you've
-added the alias, if you use that alias instead of a cap itself on the
-command-line, then no secrets are passed through the command line.  Then
-other processes on the system can still see your filenames and other
-arguments you type there, but not the caps that Tahoe-LAFS uses to permit
-access to your files and directories.
-
-
-----
-
-Capabilities may be leaked to web browser phishing filter / "safe browsing" servers
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-
-Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Chrome include a "phishing filter" or
-"safe browing" component, which is turned on by default, and which sends
-any URLs that it deems suspicious to a central server.
-
-Microsoft gives `a brief description of their filter's operation`_. Firefox
-and Chrome both use Google's `"safe browsing API"`_ (`specification`_).
-
-This of course has implications for the privacy of general web browsing
-(especially in the cases of Firefox and Chrome, which send your main
-personally identifying Google cookie along with these requests without your
-explicit consent, as described in `Firefox bugzilla ticket #368255`_.
-
-The reason for documenting this issue here, though, is that when using the
-Tahoe-LAFS web user interface, it could also affect confidentiality and integrity
-by leaking capabilities to the filter server.
-
-Since IE's filter sends URLs by SSL/TLS, the exposure of caps is limited to
-the filter server operators (or anyone able to hack the filter server) rather
-than to network eavesdroppers. The "safe browsing API" protocol used by
-Firefox and Chrome, on the other hand, is *not* encrypted, although the
-URL components are normally hashed.
-
-Opera also has a similar facility that is disabled by default. A previous
-version of this file stated that Firefox had abandoned their phishing
-filter; this was incorrect.
-

-.. _Firefox bugzilla ticket #368255: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=368255
-
-
-*how to manage it*
-
-If you use any phishing filter or "safe browsing" feature, consider either
-disabling it, or not using the WUI via that browser. Phishing filters have
-`very limited effectiveness`_ , and phishing or malware attackers have learnt
-how to bypass them.
-
-.. _very limited effectiveness: http://lorrie.cranor.org/pubs/ndss-phish-tools-final.pdf
-
-To disable the filter in IE7 or IE8:
-++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
-
-- Click Internet Options from the Tools menu.
-
-- Click the Advanced tab.
-
-- If an "Enable SmartScreen Filter" option is present, uncheck it.
-  If a "Use Phishing Filter" or "Phishing Filter" option is present,
-  set it to Disable.
-
-- Confirm (click OK or Yes) out of all dialogs.
-
-If you have a version of IE that splits the settings between security
-zones, do this for all zones.
-
-To disable the filter in Firefox:
-+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
-
-- Click Options from the Tools menu.
-
-- Click the Security tab.
-
-- Uncheck both the "Block reported attack sites" and "Block reported
-  web forgeries" options.
-
-- Click OK.
-
-To disable the filter in Chrome:
-++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
-
-- Click Options from the Tools menu.
-
-- Click the "Under the Hood" tab and find the "Privacy" section.
-
-- Uncheck the "Enable phishing and malware protection" option.
-
-- Click Close.

-Known issues in the FTP and SFTP frontends
-------------------------------------------
-
-These are documented in `docs/frontends/FTP-and-SFTP.rst`_ and on `the SftpFrontend page`_ on the wiki. 
-
-.. _docs/frontends/FTP-and-SFTP.rst: frontends/FTP-and-SFTP.rst
-.. _the SftpFrontend page: https://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs/wiki/SftpFrontend
-
-
-----
-
-Traffic analysis based on sizes of files/directories, storage indices, and timing
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-
-Files and directories stored by Tahoe-LAFS are encrypted, but the ciphertext
-reveals the exact size of the original file or directory representation.
-This information is available to passive eavesdroppers and to server operators.
-
-For example, a large data set with known file sizes could probably be
-identified with a high degree of confidence.
-
-Uploads and downloads of the same file or directory can be linked by server
-operators, even without making assumptions based on file size. Anyone who
-knows the introducer furl for a grid may be able to act as a server operator.
-This implies that if such an attacker knows which file/directory is being
-accessed in a particular request (by some other form of surveillance, say),
-then they can identify later or earlier accesses of the same file/directory.
-
-Observing requests during a directory traversal (such as a deep-check
-operation) could reveal information about the directory structure, i.e.
-which files and subdirectories are linked from a given directory.
-
-Attackers can combine the above information with inferences based on timing
-correlations. For instance, two files that are accessed close together in
-time are likely to be related even if they are not linked in the directory
-structure. Also, users that access the same files may be related to each other.

-
-Known Issues in Tahoe-LAFS v1.9.0, released 31-Oct-2011
-=======================================================
-
-
-Integrity Failure during Mutable Downloads
-------------------------------------------
-
-Under certain circumstances, the integrity-verification code of the mutable
-downloader could be bypassed. Clients who receive carefully crafted shares
-(from attackers) will emit incorrect file contents, and the usual
-share-corruption errors would not be raised. This only affects mutable files
-(not immutable), and only affects downloads that use doctored shares. It is
-not persistent: the threat is resolved once you upgrade your client to a
-version without the bug. However, read-modify-write operations (such as
-directory manipulations) performed by vulnerable clients could cause the
-attacker's modifications to be written back out to the mutable file, making
-the corruption permanent.
-
-The attacker's ability to manipulate the file contents is limited. They can
-modify FEC-encoded ciphertext in all but one share. This gives them the
-ability to blindly flip bits in roughly 2/3rds of the file (for the default
-k=3 encoding parameter). Confidentiality remains intact, unless the attacker
-can deduce the file's contents by observing your reactions to corrupted
-downloads.
-
-This bug was introduced in 1.9.0, as part of the MDMF-capable downloader, and
-affects both SDMF and MDMF files. It was not present in 1.8.3.
-
-*how to manage it*
-
-There are three options:
-
-* Upgrade to 1.9.1, which fixes the bug
-* Downgrade to 1.8.3, which does not contain the bug
-* If using 1.9.0, do not trust the contents of mutable files (whether SDMF or
-  MDMF) that the 1.9.0 client emits, and do not modify directories (which
-  could write the corrupted data back into place, making the damage
-  persistent)

-
-Known Issues in Tahoe-LAFS v1.8.2, released 30-Jan-2011
-=======================================================
-
-
-Unauthorized deletion of an immutable file by its storage index
----------------------------------------------------------------
-
-Due to a flaw in the Tahoe-LAFS storage server software in v1.3.0 through
-v1.8.2, a person who knows the "storage index" that identifies an immutable
-file can cause the server to delete its shares of that file.
-
-If an attacker can cause enough shares to be deleted from enough storage
-servers, this deletes the file.
-
-This vulnerability does not enable anyone to read file contents without
-authorization (confidentiality), nor to change the contents of a file
-(integrity).
-
-A person could learn the storage index of a file in several ways:
-
-1. By being granted the authority to read the immutable file—i.e. by being
-   granted a read capability to the file. They can determine the file's
-   storage index from its read capability.
-
-2. By being granted a verify capability to the file. They can determine the
-   file's storage index from its verify capability. This case probably
-   doesn't happen often because users typically don't share verify caps.
-
-3. By operating a storage server, and receiving a request from a client that
-   has a read cap or a verify cap. If the client attempts to upload,
-   download, or verify the file with their storage server, even if it doesn't
-   actually have the file, then they can learn the storage index of the file.
-
-4. By gaining read access to an existing storage server's local filesystem,
-   and inspecting the directory structure that it stores its shares in. They
-   can thus learn the storage indexes of all files that the server is holding
-   at least one share of. Normally only the operator of an existing storage
-   server would be able to inspect its local filesystem, so this requires
-   either being such an operator of an existing storage server, or somehow
-   gaining the ability to inspect the local filesystem of an existing storage
-   server.
-
-*how to manage it*
-
-Tahoe-LAFS version v1.8.3 or newer (except v1.9a1) no longer has this flaw;
-if you upgrade a storage server to a fixed release then that server is no
-longer vulnerable to this problem.
-
-Note that the issue is local to each storage server independently of other
-storage servers—when you upgrade a storage server then that particular
-storage server can no longer be tricked into deleting its shares of the
-target file.
-
-If you can't immediately upgrade your storage server to a version of
-Tahoe-LAFS that eliminates this vulnerability, then you could temporarily
-shut down your storage server. This would of course negatively impact
-availability—clients would not be able to upload or download shares to that
-particular storage server while it was shut down—but it would protect the
-shares already stored on that server from being deleted as long as the server
-is shut down.
-
-If the servers that store shares of your file are running a version of
-Tahoe-LAFS with this vulnerability, then you should think about whether
-someone can learn the storage indexes of your files by one of the methods
-described above. A person can not exploit this vulnerability unless they have
-received a read cap or verify cap, or they control a storage server that has
-been queried about this file by a client that has a read cap or a verify cap.
-
-Tahoe-LAFS does not currently have a mechanism to limit which storage servers
-can connect to your grid, but it does have a way to see which storage servers
-have been connected to the grid. The Introducer's front page in the Web User
-Interface has a list of all storage servers that the Introducer has ever seen
-and the first time and the most recent time that it saw them. Each Tahoe-LAFS
-gateway maintains a similar list on its front page in its Web User Interface,
-showing all of the storage servers that it learned about from the Introducer,
-when it first connected to that storage server, and when it most recently
-connected to that storage server. These lists are stored in memory and are
-reset to empty when the process is restarted.
-
-See ticket `#1528`_ for technical details.

-
-Publishing an ``A``-byte immutable file
-=======================================
-
-when the file is already uploaded
----------------------------------
-
-If the file is already uploaded with the exact same contents, same
-erasure coding parameters (K, N), and same added convergence secret,
-then it reads the whole file from disk one time while hashing it to
-compute the storage index, then contacts about N servers to ask each
-one to store a share. All of the servers reply that they already have
-a copy of that share, and the upload is done.
-
-disk: A
-

-

-

-
-when the file is not already uploaded
--------------------------------------
-
-If the file is not already uploaded with the exact same contents, same
-erasure coding parameters (K, N), and same added convergence secret,
-then it reads the whole file from disk one time while hashing it to
-compute the storage index, then contacts about N servers to ask each
-one to store a share. Then it uploads each share to a storage server.
-
-disk: 2*A
-
-cpu: 2*~A
-
-network: N/K*A
-
-memory footprint: N/K*S
-
-Publishing an ``A``-byte mutable file
-=====================================
-
-cpu: ~A + a large constant for RSA keypair generation
-
-network: A
-
-memory footprint: N/K*A
-
-notes: Tahoe-LAFS generates a new RSA keypair for each mutable file that it
-publishes to a grid. This takes up to 1 or 2 seconds on a typical desktop PC.
-
-Part of the process of encrypting, encoding, and uploading a mutable file to a
-Tahoe-LAFS grid requires that the entire file be in memory at once. For larger
-files, this may cause Tahoe-LAFS to have an unacceptably large memory footprint
-(at least when uploading a mutable file).
-
-Downloading ``B`` bytes of an ``A``-byte immutable file
-=======================================================
-
-cpu: ~B
-
-network: B
-
-notes: When Tahoe-LAFS 1.8.0 or later is asked to read an arbitrary
-range of an immutable file, only the S-byte segments that overlap the
-requested range will be downloaded.
-
-(Earlier versions would download from the beginning of the file up
-until the end of the requested range, and then continue to download
-the rest of the file even after the request was satisfied.)
-
-Downloading ``B`` bytes of an ``A``-byte mutable file
-=====================================================
-
-cpu: ~A
-
-network: A
-
-memory footprint: A
-
-notes: As currently implemented, mutable files must be downloaded in
-their entirety before any part of them can be read. We are
-exploring fixes for this; see ticket #393 for more information.
-
-Modifying ``B`` bytes of an ``A``-byte mutable file
-===================================================
-
-cpu: ~A
-
-network: A
-
-memory footprint: N/K*A
-
-notes: If you upload a changed version of a mutable file that you
-earlier put onto your grid with, say, 'tahoe put --mutable',
-Tahoe-LAFS will replace the old file with the new file on the
-grid, rather than attempting to modify only those portions of the
-file that have changed. Modifying a file in this manner is
-essentially uploading the file over again, except that it re-uses
-the existing RSA keypair instead of generating a new one.
-
-Inserting/Removing ``B`` bytes in an ``A``-byte mutable file
-============================================================
-
-cpu: ~A
-
-network: A
-
-memory footprint: N/K*A
-
-notes: Modifying any part of a mutable file in Tahoe-LAFS requires that
-the entire file be downloaded, modified, held in memory while it is
-encrypted and encoded, and then re-uploaded. A future version of the
-mutable file layout ("LDMF") may provide efficient inserts and
-deletes. Note that this sort of modification is mostly used internally
-for directories, and isn't something that the WUI, CLI, or other
-interfaces will do -- instead, they will simply overwrite the file to
-be modified, as described in "Modifying B bytes of an A-byte mutable
-file".
-
-Adding an entry to an ``A``-entry directory
-===========================================
-
-cpu: ~A
-
-network: ~A
-
-memory footprint: N/K*~A
-
-notes: In Tahoe-LAFS, directories are implemented as specialized mutable
-files. So adding an entry to a directory is essentially adding B
-(actually, 300-330) bytes somewhere in an existing mutable file.
-
-Listing an ``A`` entry directory
-================================
-
-cpu: ~A
-
-network: ~A
-
-memory footprint: N/K*~A
-
-notes: Listing a directory requires that the mutable file storing the
-directory be downloaded from the grid. So listing an A entry
-directory requires downloading a (roughly) 330 * A byte mutable
-file, since each directory entry is about 300-330 bytes in size.
-
-Performing a file-check on an ``A``-byte file
-=============================================
-
-cpu: ~G
-
-network: ~G
-
-memory footprint: negligible
-
-notes: To check a file, Tahoe-LAFS queries all the servers that it knows
-about. Note that neither of these values directly depend on the size
-of the file. This is relatively inexpensive, compared to the verify
-and repair operations.
-
-Performing a file-verify on an ``A``-byte file
-==============================================
-
-cpu: ~N/K*A
-
-network: N/K*A
-
-memory footprint: N/K*S
-
-notes: To verify a file, Tahoe-LAFS downloads all of the ciphertext
-shares that were originally uploaded to the grid and integrity checks
-them. This is (for well-behaved grids) more expensive than downloading
-an A-byte file, since only a fraction of these shares are necessary to
-recover the file.
-
-Repairing an ``A``-byte file (mutable or immutable)
-===================================================
-
-cpu: variable, between ~A and ~N/K*A
-
-network: variable; between A and N/K*A
-
-memory footprint (immutable): (1+N/K)*S
-              (SDMF mutable): (1+N/K)*A
-
-notes: To repair a file, Tahoe-LAFS downloads the file, and
-generates/uploads missing shares in the same way as when it initially
-uploads the file.  So, depending on how many shares are missing, this
-can cost as little as a download or as much as a download followed by
-a full upload.
-
-Since SDMF files have only one segment, which must be processed in its
-entirety, repair requires a full-file download followed by a full-file
-upload.
